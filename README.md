##  Project Overview

This project explores a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI, to analyze patient demographics, wait times, satisfaction scores, department Referrals, and admission outcomes. The goal is to uncover trends that will enable hospitals, stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
 
 ## Key Performance Metrics
- ✅ No of patients
- ✅ Average wait time
- ✅ Patient satisfaction score
- ✅ No of patient referred

## Dataset Description
**Fields:**
- `Patient Id` – Unique identifier
- `Patient Admission Date` – Date of visit
- `Patient First Initial`, `Patient Last Name`, `Patient Full Name` – De-identified names
- `Patient Gender`, `Patient Age`, `Patient Race` – Demographics
- `Department Referral` – Department to which the patient was referred
- `Patient Admission Flag` – Whether the patient was admitted
- `Patient Satisfaction Score` – Feedback rating (e.g., 1–5 scale)
- `Patient Waittime` – Wait time before service
- `Patients CM` – Case manager assigned (if any)


## Tools Used:
- **Power BI** _ for dashboards and interactive visuals
- **Power query** –  for data cleaning
- **Excel** –  for initial data exploration


## Key Insights:
**The emergency room dataset covering a period of 19 months records a total of 9,216 unique patients.**
-	The average wait time was approximately 35.3 mins indicating a need for improvement to enhance patient flow. 
-	The average Patient Satisfaction Score was 4.99 out of 10, suggesting moderate satisfaction and highlighting areas for improving patient experience. 
-	A significant number of patient (5400) did not require referrals. Among those referred, the most common were General Practice (1840 cases) and orthopedics (995 cases), followed by physiotherapy (276 cases) and cardiology (248 cases)
-	The busiest days were Saturdays (1377 patients), Thursdays (1332 patients), Sundays (1318 patients), Mondays (1314 patients), the busiest hour were 11am, 7pm, 1pm and 11pm indicating the need of ample staffing during this period.
-	Patients Demographics: Age group-adult (30 - 39 years) formed a large group (1200 patients) followed by young adult (20 - 29 years) with 1188 patients. 
-	Race Distribution: The largest racial was white (2571) followed by African American (1959), multi-racial (1557), Asian 1060 patients. A significant number of patients 1030 declined to identify their race.
-	Admission Pattern: More than half of the patients (4612) were admitted, while the rest were treated and discharged.

##  Objectives
-	To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance
- Monitor key metrics and trends on a month-by-month basis to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
- Offer granular insights into patient-level data to enable detailed analysis and troubleshooting
- Summarize the findings from all dashboards to provide clear and actionable insights for stakeholders

## What I Did:
-	Cleaned and transformed the data for consistency and analysis
-	Visualized wait times across departments and patient groups
-	Investigated how demographics influenced satisfaction
-	Built charts/dashboards to identify bottlenecks in patient flow
  
 ## Project Outcomes:
 This project gave me deeper insight into healthcare operational data and demonstrated how analytics can highlight inefficiencies
